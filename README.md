**WARNING: This module still needs additional work. Tests need to be fixed/modified and might contain breaking changes in the future.**

Provides a SS_List type that allows combining various list types (DataList, ArrayList, etc).
The use case for this is to have for example, 3 promoted items ordered by a CMS user (ArrayList) and the rest be events ordered by time.
